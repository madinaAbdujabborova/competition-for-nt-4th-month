# NT 4th Month Kaggle Competition
Welcome to the repository for the 4th Month Kaggle Competition of our training program! This project focuses on solving a classification problem using machine learning techniques and optimizing model performance. The dataset is hosted on Kaggle, and the goal is to achieve the highest possible ROC-AUC score on the test set.

## Project Overview
In this project, we explore various classification methods to build a model that can accurately predict the target variable. The primary steps include:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and preparing features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding data distributions, correlations, and insights to guide model selection.
Modeling: Building different classification models and tuning them to maximize the ROC-AUC score.
Evaluation: Using metrics like ROC-AUC to evaluate model performance.
Submission: Generating predictions for Kaggle submissions.

## Files in This Repository
data/: Contains the dataset files.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks with data exploration, modeling, and analysis.
src/: Python scripts for data processing, feature engineering, and model building.
README.md: Project documentation.
requirements.txt: List of dependencies required to run the project.

cd competition-for-nt-4th-month
3. Run the Jupyter notebooks in notebooks/ to explore data and train models.

## Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
Includes feature selection, handling missing values, and transformations.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed analysis to understand the dataset characteristics and relationships among features.

3. Model Training and Tuning
Experimented with multiple classification algorithms and hyperparameter tuning to improve the ROC-AUC score.

4. Evaluation and Submission
Finalized the model based on the ROC-AUC score and generated predictions for the test set.

## Results and Analysis
The final model achieved an ROC-AUC score of [Insert ROC-AUC score here] on the test set.
